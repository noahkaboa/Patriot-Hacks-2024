        <h3> Main Idea</h3>
        <p> As college students, we know how overwhelming it can be to be in a completely new town. We wanted to create a website that helps people plan out an adventure, regardless of their interests or what they're feeling for the day. <br> Not only is our goal to help people become acquainted with a new environment, but we also wanted to create a site that promotes small businesses. </p>

    <div class="how-works">
        <h3> How it Works </h3>
        <p> Users can input their interests to help curate their perfect day in their town, specifically targeting small businesses and underrated spots! </p>

        <h3> Our Team </h3>
        <p> Our team is titled GÎ£U, inspired by our school names being GMU and GWU! <br> This is our first time competing at PatriotHacks and we are so thrilled to be participating! </p>
