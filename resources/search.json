          "description": "Little quaint brewery located at Lake Anne waterfront. When I approached the place, my first impression was that it was located in somebodys basement. But opening the door, I was pleasantly surprised with clean and neat brewery and friendly greeting by the staff at the counter behind, which had about 10 taps all brewed in-store. The weather was a dampener. Otherwise, we could have sat on the deck by the river, sipping the drinks. Beer selection ranges from lighter to IPA to dark ones. They have cider, shandy, and Kombucha options, too. Food options are limited to nice, warm pretzels and some packaged snacks, which is expected in a small local brewery like this. The good news is they have a great neighbors serving good food like Lake Anne Coffee House and Kalypso. You can get the food ordered from there or bring your own food.",

The beer was clean and well done and, as a nice change, just simpler styles done right. The heater and fire on the patio were nice to see since sitting outdoors nowadays is a safer bet than indoors.\n\nThe staff were friendly and the pretzels (Nordic Knot) were great. My only gripe would be that the take home options were very limited which means I can't take such good beer to go.",

          "description": "Lake Anne is a quaint location which offers a nice spot to sit back and relax. I found this brewery by random Google map search and I'm glad I did. It is a small brewery but offers some nice seating both inside and outside. It is nestled around the inlet of the lake, which offers a nice atmosphere. They have some good beer options, including a shandy which can be mixed with several different options. Friendly staff and a fun time. Stop in for a beer and a pretzel, you will not be disappointed.",
